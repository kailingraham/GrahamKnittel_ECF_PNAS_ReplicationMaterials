    "# 1. EIA fossil fuel power plant emissions data\n",
    "The EIA has data on the annual emissions of each fossil fuel power plant in the U.S., available at https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/. Documentation for this data is availaale here: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/guide/pdf/guide.pdf. This data is obtained through the annual EIA-860 and EIA-923 surveys and covers 7 'sectors' of plant, including both commercial and industrial facilities that are merely connected to the grid and can sell power. Because we are considering the emissions associated with jobs in the fossil fuel electricty generation industry, commercial and industrial facilities should be excluded, as the jobs at these facilities are likely to be captured as manufacturing jobs, commercial jobs, etc. in employment databases and not classified as power generation jobs, which would inflate emissions intensities for the reported fossil fuel power generation workers in a given region."

    "### 2.3.1 Winsorize data\n",
    "The USEER data, since it is partially imputed, contains several points where the employment figures do not match what we would reasonably expect given a plant' or county's generation, capacity or emissions data. For example, many counties' employment as reported by USEER are less than 1 employee, often in counties where there is significant power generation activity, while others might have employment figures greater than 1 but still far lower than we would expect given the power generation in the region. Because of this, data was winsorized to rationalize these errors. Generally, it is preferable to winsorize inputs variables rather than the outcome variable, which in this case is carbon intensity per employee. Three different types of winsorization were considered:\n",
    "1. <b>Winsorizing county-level employment so that all counties with electric power generation report at least 1 employee.</b> This ensure that negative employment values and values between 0 and 1 are fixed.\n",
    "2. <b>Calculating nameplate capacity and annual generation per employee (in MW/employee and MWh/employee, respectively), and winsorizing these distributions.</b> We would expect the number of employees at a plant to be roughly proportional to the size of the plant, which can be indicated by the capacity or generation of the plant. These ratios of plant size to employment likely different amongst fuel groups, so these indicators will be computed for each fuel group separately.\n",
    "3. <b>Winsorizing county-level carbon intensity per employee.</b> Even after the above winsorizations, there are still one or two counties with extremely high carbon intensities. Winsorizing carbon intensity at the 99th percentile rectifies these anomalies without significantly altering the distribution of the outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, these parameters were used to derive revised employment estimates for each county, leaving the emissions data (which were not derived using imputation) intact."

    "#### 2.3.1.2 Winsorize MW/employee and/or MWh/employee\n",
    "To determine at which percentile to winsorize these variables to, the largest county-level carbon intensity was determined and compared for several different winsorization configurations. Also, average MWh/employee values after winsorization were compared to values provided in the literature. Wei et al. (2009) report job-years/GWh for the O&M & fuel processing for Coal and Natural Gas plants to be 0.09 and 0.08, which equate to 11,111 and 12,500 MWh/employee, respectively (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421509007915). Additionally, Kis et al. (2018) find the jobs/PJ/year for coal plants to be between 10-20 jobs/PJ/year (13,889-27,778 MWh/employee), and between 5-15 jobs/PJ/year (18,519-55,556 MWh/employee) for gas plants (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518303239). Given these literature values, different winsorization configurations were compared based on three objectives:\n",
    "1. Yield a mean MWh/employee value in the same order of magnitude as those in the literature (between 13,889 and 55,556 MWh/employee)\n",
    "2. Minimize the number of datapoints altered through winsorization\n",
    "3. Ensure that the maximum carbon intensity per employee after winsorization is reasonable (i.e. below 100k tonCO2e/employee).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute these configurations, different combinations of winsorization cutoffs for MW/employee and MWh/employee were used and new employment and carbon intensity figures were calculated, and summary statistics printed. The code below performs these operations. Note that in order to compute the carbon intensity per employee, this figure was winsorized at the 99th percentile for each iteration."

    "<b>Findings & discussion from winsorization:</b> Firstly, it is clear that winsorizing MWh/employee has a greater effect on carbon intensity than MW/employee. Winsorizing MWh/employee at the 95th percentile reduces the maximum carbon intensity by ~65%, while doing the same to the MW/employee distribution yields a 53% reduction, and this trend continues as more aggressive winsorizations are trialed. Secondly, it is also apparent that there is little benefit in winsorizing both MW/employee and MWh/employee as opposed to only one of the distributions. When comparing different winsorizations of MWh/employee with MW/employee winsorized at 70% to the same winsorizations of MWh/employee but with no winsorization of MW/employee, we see that there is little change in the maximum and mean carbon intensity past the 95% winsorization of MWh/employee, but there is a material difference in the number of winsorized datapoints. From these two findings, it seems preferable to winsorize MWh/employee and to leave the MW/employee distribution intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the different winsorizations of MWh/employee conducted, <b>a winsorization at the 75th percentile seems most appropriate.</b> While none of the attempted winsorizations achieve goal 3, winsorizing at 75% achieves goal 1 while reasonably minimizing the number of altered datapoints. It is clear that, in order to achieve goal 3, further winsorization is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the plants within counties where MWh/emp was winsorized, the majority of these are Sectors 1 or 2 (i.e. indepedent power producers with the primary business purpose of producing power) with large capacities and unrealisitically low USEER employment figures. In the majority of cases, these plants are the only plants in their county. While there is a large spread of nameplate capacities for these facilities, up to 4 GW, the modal capacity for the winsorized plants is less than 100 MW.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, when we consider the plants in the remaining counties that still have very high carbon intensities per employee following the MWh/employee winsorization, we find that these are overwhelmingly Sector 7 (industrial plants that generate power) and are mostly low capacity (<70MW) with very low employment figures. These Sector 7 plants only represent a small fraction of total Sector 7 plants in the U.S., and are often the only plant in the county, therefore although they might not have a high absolute carbon footprint, they make the whole county have a high carbon intensity per employee. Furthermore, many of these (and other) Sector 7 plants were not winsorized in the MWh/employee winsorization, likely because they both export and import electricity to and from the grid resulting in a low net generation figure that is not necessarily proportional to their emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when looking at the counties where employment was winsorized to a minimum of 1 employee, we find that these counties are overwhelmingly low capacity (<25 MW) and have only one plant in the county. Many of these counties were winsorized again by the MWh/employee winsorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us several things. Firstly, as already discussed, it indicates that the USEER dataset underestimates employment for counties i) with only one plant in the county and/or ii) with low-capacity plants. This makes sense, given the dataset's reliance on imputation; trends identified during imputation may not hold as well at low capacities and with few plants per county, resulting in employment figures that are skewed for these counties. This validates the use of aggressive winsorizations on an MWh/employee basis. Secondly, we also find that industrial plants are particularly prone to this error, as the nature of their operation means that correlations between net generation and employment may be weak or non-existent. This points to a need for winsorization of another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these errors in low-capacity, sparse counties, we will:\n",
    "1. Winsorize MWh/employee at the 75th percentile for all plants;\n",
    "2. Winsorize carbon intensity per employee aggressively (75th percentile) for counties where there is only one plant in the county and that plant belongs to one of Sector Codes 4, 5, 6 or 7 (i.e. a commercial or industrial plant); and\n",
    "3. Winsorize the remaining counties at the 99th percentile to deal with any remaining outlier counties."
